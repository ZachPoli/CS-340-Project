Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I follow several best practices. Firstly, I ensure that my code is well-structured and follows a consistent style guide.
For the CRUD Python module from Project One, I used clear naming conventions, which made it easy to understand the purpose of each function. I also included docstrings and comments to document the code, making it more readable and easier to maintain.

The CRUD moduleâ€™s design promotes adaptability by abstracting the database operations, allowing for the code to be reused without modification in different parts of the application or in future projects. The modular nature of the CRUD operations means that changes in the database schema or the switch to a different database system would require minimal changes to the codebase.

The advantages of working in this way are numerous. It reduces the risk of errors since each CRUD operation is defined in one place and can be tested independently. It also speeds up development time for the dashboard in Project Two because the database operations were already defined and could be easily integrated.

In the future, this CRUD module could be expanded to support more complex queries and operations. It could also be adapted to work with different types of databases or used as a template for other projects that require database interactions.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
My approach as a computer scientist is methodical and analytical. For the dashboard requirements set by Grazioso Salvare, I began by understanding the data and the client's needs.
I then planned the structure of the dashboard, considering the user experience and the data flow. This project differed from previous assignments as it was more client-driven and required the integration of a backend database with a frontend application.

In the future, I would use techniques such as data modeling to create databases that efficiently meet client requests. I would also engage in iterative testing and user feedback sessions to refine the database and its interface.

The Role of Computer Scientists and Impact of Work
Computer scientists solve problems using technology. They create software and systems that can process data, automate tasks, and provide insights. Our work matters because it can significantly enhance efficiency, accuracy, and the decision-making process in organizations.

For a company like Grazioso Salvare, my work on the dashboard project can streamline their process of selecting dogs for rescue training. It provides them with a tool to quickly filter and visualize data, making the selection process more efficient and data-driven. This, in turn, can lead to better outcomes in rescue operations and ultimately save lives.

The broader impact of such work is immense as it can be applied to various fields, from healthcare to environmental conservation, highlighting the versatile and transformative nature of computer science.
